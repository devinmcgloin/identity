Sail is a generative art framework. It’s not designed for anyone to use. Sail
exists to make it simpler to play around with new ideas and render new pieces
of artwork.

It’s all open source, feel free to fork it if you want to. It currently only
renders out PNGs, a flaw I’d like to fix in the near future.

It currently uses [fogelman/gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) under the hood.
This may change as it doesn’t support SVG or PDF rendering.

You can see some of the images generated by Sail on the [Artwork](/artwork)
page.
