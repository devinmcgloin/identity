I can help but feel that a lot of these posts are missing the crux of the issue; which in this case isn’t really about applications of algorithms’ or differing value systems but rather the implications of having actors which lack values of their own making moral choices'"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Role of Artificial Intelligence","date":"Saturday, December 27th 02014","tags":["Machine Intelligence","Humane Software"]},"fields":{"slug":"/writing/2014/role-of-ai/"},"excerpt":"The goal of Artificial Intelligence, and in many ways computing as a field, is to remove the busy work. To remove the clerical from the equation leaving us to glean greater insights. In this way, I don't think of Artificial Intelligence as taking away the jobs created by such tasks, instead creating thousands of new fields waiting for people to leap in and explore. This does, however, require a shift in thinking, from looking for steady reliable incomes to experimenting with different fields and taking on projects as opposed to careers. When people choose to devote themselves fully to a new idea and have the help of an AI to aid their research and learning, people will create more, and enjoy their work and the work of others more."}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Machine Intelligence"}}}
