As the brave one approached with heavy feet it began to light up, slowly it flashed first red then white and repeated, red, white, red, white. Perplexed but undaunted the brave one approached more cautiously. The further he progressed without incident the more confident he became, at about 20 yards away it pulsed again, this time with a vivid green it began to expand slowly at first, but faster and faster. It began to hum louder, and instead of an occasional noise, it began to CLACK incessantly. This startled them all, including the brave one. They ran back, further and further. 150 yds.

The environment here on Karive was violent and unpredictable, much of it unknown. It is impossible for them to know, but they have encountered a rather simple mechanism left behind from the first attempt. Or at least that is what it was commonly refereed to as. When human spaceflight was beginning to show true colonial promise the first attempt was sent to Karive in the year 2112. This attempt ended in near disaster after they suffered a critical engine failure of unknown origin.

They sped up and approached the settlement. Each settlement had 16 pods, in each pod there were 2 families. A family consisted of 2 parents and 2 children, no more no less. Across the surface of Karive there were a total of 78 settlements, which means there are a total of 9984 individuals living on Karive. No more, no less. Each pod had a specific purpose, Pods 1-6 were food pods, they are responsible for the production of food for all members in their settlement. Pods 6-8 is Maintenance, responsible for keeping current systems operational. Pod 9 is Engineering, responsible for systems upgrades. Pods 10-12 is scientific research, which is sent back to Earth. Pods 12-14 are the Heritage Pods, which are devoted to passing the culture of Earth on to the next generations.
