excerpt: Ingalls describes Smalltalk, a language that “Provides Computer support for the create spirit in everyone”. I love how the paper starts off with the describing the purpose of a language as communicating models between the user to the compuer, the goal is to develop an expressive yet simple language that that empowers its users. Ingalls goes over 17 principles that all languges ought to follow.

Ingalls describes [Smalltalk][2], a language that "Provides Computer support for
the create spirit in everyone". Smalltalk is a language, just as Spanish, German
or English are languages. The goal of this language, and all others, is to send
a model from one individual to another. In order to do so they have to have the
same initial assumptions. That is they both speak the same language, and have
similar linguistic concepts to work of off.

## Implicit and Explicit Communication

Somewhat famously this is [Licklider's Intergalactic Computer Network][3]
problem. Licklider questions “how do you get communications started among
totally uncorrelated “sapient” beings?” Licklider and Ingalls are talking about
the same fundamental idea of transmitting a model from one entity to another.
It's interesting to note how often this communication problem pops up in
different contexts, the same issue is present in mathematics where different
notation means different things in different fields, or philosophy where terms
mean something to a different group and an entirely different thing to another.
These groups need a shared language in order to collaborate.

Ingalls notices that it does not matter if the model is being transmitted from
person to person, machine to machine or from person to machine or vice versa.
There is a certain amount of fundamental knowledge required to transmit a model
and have it be understood in the manner it was intend. Ingalls terms this
initial knowledge to be implicit communication, and the model itself as explicit
communication.

Most of human language is built upon the implicit communication, in fact Ingalls
notes that "Human language is built upon allusion". Part of the work I've been
doing with Blaze, is about how we get the same model in the computer as we have
in our own heads. Smalltalk acknowledging this distinction sets itself apart
from other languages at the time.

## Object Oriented Programming

One of the legacies from the Smalltalk system is Object Oriented Programming
(OOP). Steve Jobs does an excellent job of explaining OOP with the following
from [Rolling Stone's 1994 Interview of Jobs][4]:

> Objects are like people. They're living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like we're doing right here.
>
> Here's an example: If I'm your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, "Can you get my clothes laundered, please." I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and say, "Here are your clean clothes."
>
> You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you can't even hail a taxi. You can't pay for one, you don't have dollars in your pocket. Yet I knew how to do all of that. And you didn't have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction. That's what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to that complexity are high level.

Guy Steele talks about how Java embodied similar ideas in [Growing a
language][5] at the 1998 OOPSLA Conference. Steele begins by limiting his
vocabulary to primitives. For Steele primitives are words with one syllable.
From these primitives he builds more complex words, to talk about the evolution
of java. Steele has to set the implicit state of the language explicitly, and
build up the shared model of the world.

OOP is a great way to think about programs and abstract away complexity. But it
has fallen short of the goals smalltalk has laid out. While it is true that we
think about things in terms of objects in the actual world, the systems the
computer knows about have not been built in a manner that is intuitive to us.
For the object model to be entirely useful to us we must have objects that
behave in similar ways to the way normal objects behave. The issue is building
up the shared implicit models to facilitate this communication.

Programming languages are not meant to be learned, they're supposed to be
implemented. This seems to be a fatal flaw when it comes to a system that can
build up shared representations and make meaningful use of the objects it knows
about.

## Smalltalk's Ambitions

When Smalltalk first arrived in 1972, OOP was an entirely new way to look at the
world. Ingalls goes on to explain the role of Smalltalk beyond just a normal
programming language:

> This fact is responsible for the difficulty of explaining Smalltalk to people who view computer languages in a more restricted sense. Smalltalk is not simply a better way of organizing procedures or a different technique for storage management. It is not just an extensible hierarchy of data types, or a graphical user interface. It is all of these things and anything else that is needed to support the interactions shown in figure 1.

Smalltalk's "extensible hierarchy of data types" or OOP isn't really the point,
the point is to allow the user to think in a manner that is natural to them. The
key concept being that the tools are made to fit the user, not the other way
round. Surprisingly enough we haven't made a lot of progress on this point. We
have made excellent progress with OOP, but the user and the computer still lack
a shared implicit model of the world.

We have a lot of initiatives to help people learn to code. [Year of Code][6],
[Code.org][7], [Yes we Code][8] as well as [videos][9] declaring computer
science the new literacy. I don't think these initiatives are a bad thing, but
we would be more successful if we acknowledged that computers have different
intuitions from us. They fundamentally think in a radically different and
bizarre way to most of us. Smalltalk has shown us the way, we have to create
systems that have shared implicit models with their users, and allow them to
communicate with a user easily. Despite this, there seems to be a focus on
moulding the user to the programming language, and thats a shame.

It's a shame because it alienates people from technology, and creates a hard
line between those who are able to code and those who cannot. The emphasis is on
thinking about efficiency and algorithms for image manipulation or audio
compression, which are without a doubt important tasks.

Yet very few people will care to implement their own compression system, and
Open Source Libraries are good enough for most tasks. The vast majority of time
is spent combatting incidental complexity, and therefore writing simple systems
and code is 10x more important than small increases in efficiency.

The more adaptable the system, the empowering it is. If they can transmit the
model in their heads, to a model in the machine, there would be no bounds in
what man and machine can achieve _together_.
