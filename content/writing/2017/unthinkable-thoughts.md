How do we think? What is the process of developing new thoughts? Moreover, how
can we think new thoughts quicker and understand a body of knowledge faster?

Just as a to-do list helps us remember, and a notepad helps us perform
calculations, computers can help us immensely when it comes to thinking
previously unthinkable thoughts.

What does it mean to think the unthinkable?

I should clarify, what exactly what **unthinkable thoughts** are. Richard
Hamming phrased these limitations best in [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of
Mathematics](https://papers.devinmcgloin.com/mathematics/Hamming%20-%20The%20Unreasonable%20Effectiveness%20of%20Mathematics.pdf)
with the following:

> Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they are, does the remark, "Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think," surprise you?

â€•Richard Hamming

Traditionally we create tools to augment our own faculties. We wanted to fell
trees, so we created the saw. We wanted to combine pieces of wood,
so we created the hammer. However, we can also augment how we approach those
problems in the first place, this is what it means augment human intellect.

Previously unthinkable thoughts is perhaps a more accurate term. As we increase
our own intellect thru new tools or methodologies we are able to go out in the
world and solve problems that were previously unsolvable. The goal of computers
is to think thoughts that were previously unthinkable, irregardless of what
domain those thoughts apply to. This is also a virtuous cycle, the more we can
think new thoughts, and discover new things, the more we can improve our tools
to think better thoughts.

Computers open up a whole lot of new possibilities. The tasks that the computer
is good at - boring, repetitive, mindless tasks - humans loathe doing, as spend
an immense amount of time getting around doing them. The tasks that we enjoy,
are incredibly difficult for computers to complete. J.C.R. Licklider spoke of
this relationship in the [Man-Computer
Symbiosis](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html) .

Its important to remember that computing is in its infancy. There are an
infinite amount of improvements we can make, and they're all out there. The way
in which we interact with computers today will be immensely different from how
we interact with them in a year, or 5 years.
