You may be able to say there is no answer, but that doesn't mean that
it doesn't scare you, or at least that's the case for me. It's so easy
to understand logically that it must be so, but it is still terrifying
to look at it. There's a certain sort of deep sorrow that accompanies
an idea like this. Something that wells up inside you, questioning
everything you've ever thought and everything you've ever done.

Was that the right choice, or was your brain deceiving you, enamored
by fiction instead of what we consider to be fact. Dealing with
ambiguity is one of the most challenging aspects of AI, at it appears
that humans do it with ease. I don't think that's the case. It's true
that we're able to reference abstract ideas and concepts, but the deep
seeded ambiguity and dimensionality of our state of being frightens
us, and so we ignore it. Like an infinite storm, it looms over us,
warping our minds and our perspectives, but worse than that there is
no end, no terminus to the ambiguity. No ultimate appeal, rational
thought our empirical data can prepare us for the unknown. It's so
terrifying because it's a lack of anything or at least a lack of
something we can comprehend.

If there is one thing that terrifies me it would have to be this. It's
not just a fear of the unknown it's a fear of lack of meaning or
purpose. Instead of convictions we are left with nothing, nowhere to
turn but to look at the infinite, not something and fear its
arrival. In the meantime, we wonder about purpose and drive. What is
the good life, how does one attain it? But nobody knows. A prominent
thought is to explore and expand one's knowledge, think thoughts that
are new and fresh. Augment yourself; make better tools in order to
think more abstractly, to comprehend. I'm not so sure if this is the
best way. When I pursue it I feel an unnerving acceleration, as
irreversible so things are speeding faster and faster. I'm not so sure
I enjoy that feeling; the issue is what alternative do I have?
