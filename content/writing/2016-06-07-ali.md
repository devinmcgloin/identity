I never really spent time thinking about Muhammad Ali. Of course I knew who he
was, I knew about his drive and determination, and his desire to push himself
further. What I did not know, and perhaps this is because I was born in 1995,
was Ali's fight's outside the ring.

Vox recently published this excellent video about the life of Muhammad Ali:

What I didn't know about Ali are perhaps his most defining attributes. He
emphasized living a moral life. He was perhaps one of the most
prominent people to do so. He used his prominence to advocate for tolerance,
understanding and above all a focus on morality.

## Race Relations and Draft Dodgers

Ali could have given in to the draft, many people did. He could have burned his
draft card or exploited loopholes. He could have left the country. However, he
did none of those things. Instead opting to fight the draft head on.

In the process he lost his career, livelihood and title. Many weaker people
would have given in, but not Ali. People refuse to do things for lots of
different reasons. Some valid, others not. If Ali objected to something it was
principled and focused. _He made clear his intentions and his reasons._

His intentionality comes from his principles. His perspective as a black
American born in the South in the forties places morals in check. The world
becomes more clear than it could ever be when there exist extremes. To Ali, race
relations aren't a question of perspective, or heritage. They are not a _grey
area._ To be clear, there are grey areas, but in order to consider fighting in
the muck, we should first fight in the steady ground.

Muhammad Ali's fights are rooted in a principled way of viewing the world, and
principles are an incredibly powerful mechanism for change. Ali's words reflect
an intent to push beyond.

> When I feel pain, that’s when I start counting, because that’s when it really
> counts.

The goal for Ali, both in training and, I would hypothesize, in life is to
fight for a moral view of the world.

## Fight Frameworks

For Ali and many other athletes, their sport informs their way of viewing the
world. Similarly a man with a hammer sees all his problems as nails. This is
generally seen as a detriment, not a benefit. Generally I would agree, but there
is something special about boxing that requires extra consideration.

I like to think of the special mindset boxing places a boxer in as a **Fight
Framework**. What makes boxing unique? More specifically what did Ali take from
boxing to inform his view of the world?

To start boxing has clear expectations and rules. There is a defined space, the
ring, in which a match occurs. Once you're in the ring, you're in it till the
end. Importantly the result of the match is painfully physical, you feel the
result of a bad fight more viscerally then you do in other activities. In a very
real sense you're putting a great deal on the line.

After the match you can ask yourself, "Was I good enough?" and have a definitive
answer. There is no ambiguity regarding your own performance, and in this sense
there are very clear rewards, and just yourself to blame for a poor fight, and
yourself to praise for a good one. You can always ask yourself if you could have
done more, and the answer is always yes. In fact in boxing, this is the only
thing under your own control.

A boxer enters the ring, and is tested. They leave the ring bruised, and some
never come back. The good boxers do, because they know what it means to best
competitors with sheer force of will and unbridled confidence.

Ali is unique because not only did he use this mindset in regards to boxing, but
also to social issues. Muhammad Ali's moral framework guides his will.

> Last night I had a dream, When I got to Africa,
I had one hell of a rumble.
I had to beat Tarzan’s behind first,
For claiming to be King of the Jungle.
For this fight, I’ve wrestled with alligators,
I’ve tussled with a whale.
I done handcuffed lightning
And throw thunder in jail.
You know I’m bad.
just last week, I murdered a rock,
Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick.
I’m so mean, I make medicine sick.
I’m so fast, man,
I can run through a hurricane and don’t get wet.
When George Foreman meets me,
He’ll pay his debt.
I can drown the drink of water, and kill a dead tree.
Wait till you see Muhammad Ali.

Muhammad Ali (1942 - 2016)
