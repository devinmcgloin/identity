I'm currently working on a photosharing site. It's not up and running yet, but you can find some info at [fok.al](https://fok.al).

The details of what Fokal is supposed to be a still up in the air. Here are
some of the core principles:

* Image Publishing model similar to [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com)
* Programmatic Access through a simple API
* Machine Learning for Image Search and Recommendation
* Emphasis on Metadata especially geographic data
* Robust Image Filtering

The core thesis is that exposing metadata to the user is useful and that a
mixture of machine intelligence and human recommendation can yield valuable
results in a very subjective aesthetic domain.

There is a gap between current solutions for managing your own photo collection
in say Google Photos, or Apple Photos and looking through what someone has
posted online. There is value in applying similar principles to public
photosharing websites.

The goal of Fokal is to strike a balance between user curation and
recommendation, and using machine learning to do the same.
