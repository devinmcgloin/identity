An implementation of common algorithms and data structures in Java. The goal with this project was to become more familiar with common data structures by implementing them. My interest wained about halfway through the endeavor and I decided to focus on more interesting things.

Implemented:

- Sorts
- Data structures
- Searches
- Graph Algorithms
- Simple Encryption
