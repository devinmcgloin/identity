[Parking][1] is a take on the common API design problem of creating a parking garage.
While this served as the initial inspiration, the project drifted into more of a
live art / human connection piece.

Users claim their parking spot by hovering their cursor over the spot, if they
stop hovering they loose the spot. As a result of this if a spot is occupied,
you (the viewer) knows exactly what another person is doing right at this
second.

You don't know their gender, location or political affiliation. You just know
what a fellow human being is doing at this very second.

Parking was built with Websockets and React. Drones were added to spice things
up if a human connection is unavaliable.
