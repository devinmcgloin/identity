excerpt: "How woodworking also applies to software. As with
woodworking the goal of software is not to produce a piece of software, but
rather to produce a quality piece of software. Approaching software as a craft
improves how we think about software development."

Why does a woodworker make a piece of furniture, boat or anything else for that
matter? A avid woodworker may produce many examples of each category, to what
end to they take upon this endeavor?

Perhaps every chair they make has a slightly improved design, maybe they execute
an old design better then they could before or they may use different materials.

With every new chair comes increased understanding. A different back on chair
\#4, or a different joint on chair \#6. As more chairs are produced the woodworker
converges on _Quality_. Each chair becomes a better experience for those who
have the pleasure of experiencing it.

A woodworker works both to increase the Quality of the objects they produce, and
because they relish the act of making something from raw materials. The goal is
almost never to create a specific chair of a specific level of Quality, but
rather to make the next chair even better than the last. If each chair can be
better then the last, then there are always small tweaks to be made that make a
specific chair better for its context.

Architects make similar choices, the trade offs they make change how people
experience the space. The question becomes: What tools do we have at our disposal
to elicit a specific experience and what experience do we want people to have?

Quality woodworking does not rely only upon the technical skills of carving or
making a sturdy join. It's also about knowing what to carve, and understanding
the context of where a piece will reside.

Traditionally a young Woodworker would increase their skills by taking an
apprenticeship with a master woodworker. The quicker the young woodworker
improves the more time they spend making objects of Quality. The young
woodworker doesn't only learn how to build a chair, but rather learns how to
craft a chair of Quality. One that people enjoy using and tell their family,
friends and colleagues about.

This way of approaching woodworking also applies to software. As with
woodworking the goal of software is not to produce a piece of software, but
rather to produce a quality piece of software.

Similar to a young woodworker, my goal is to improve the quality of software I
create. The best way to do that is to find the steepest learning curve possible.
I want to help build things that I'm proud of, and that others value.

In the past Architecture or Woodworking would have been the best places to apply
an interest in Quality design. Now the best place is software. The best place to
make an impact in the modern world is increasingly software.

There's a quotation from Bret Victor that I like to refer back to on occasion.

> People turn to software to learn the meaning of words, learn which countries
> were bombed today, and learn to cook a paella. They decide which music to
> play, which photos to print, and what to do tonight, tomorrow, and Tuesday at
> 2:00. They keep track of a dozen simultaneous conversations in private
> correspondence, and maybe hundreds in public arenas. They browse for a book
> for Mom, a coat for Dad, and a car for Junior. They look for an apartment to
> live in, and a bed for that apartment, and perhaps a companion for the bed.
> They ask when the movie is playing, and how to drive to the theater, and where
> to eat before the movie, and where to get cash before they eat. They ask for
> numbers, from simple sums to financial projections. They ask about money, from
> stock quote histories to bank account balances. They ask why their car isn’t
> working and how to fix it, why their child is sick and how to fix her. They no
> longer sit on the porch speculating about the weather—they ask software.

Bret's quotation illustrates the impact software has, and the responsibility of
software engineers to design software of _Quality_.

With producing Quality the focus of a software developer, what applications of Quality
software are the most impact full?

It seems like focusing on one sector or another is less value then focusing on
the specific application. The key question for any given application is how well
the piece of software aligns with the users mental model. Broadly speaking
the interaction between humans and software can be split into three distinct
segments.

- **Communication:**
  When a user communicates with another user through a software interaction.
- **Manipulation:**
  When a user manipulates an object they have a mental model of inside a
  computer.
- **Education:**
  When a user uses software to probe the world and understand their
  surroundings.

I am less interested in designing interactions between machines, and more
focused on what a person and computer can do together. How do we make those
interactions more empowering, expressive and productive?

Infused in this question is a question of representation. I care about how the
representation is presented to the computer as well as how it is represented to
the user. The representation to the computer seems more impact full and scalable
to me.

If you know of places that think about software in a similar manner, produce
software of high quality and would be a good place to learn the ways of the bits
please let me know.
